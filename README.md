# Treehouse_Project_6_Static_NodeJS_Express_Site
The sixth project for Treehouse.  This is a portfolio site to showcase the other projects.

# Motivation
Motivation behind this project is to continue my learning within the fullstack JavaScript program. This focused on backend JavaScript by using Express, Nodejs, and Pug templates

# Features
Features include the following:
- Home page that lists my completed projects
- Ability to select a project and be navigated to the page for the project which includes descriptions, images, and links to live demos or the repos
- An About page that tells the user a little bit about me
- Error handling to provide better context to users what when went wrong

# Custom Enhancements
- Changed background-color to a very light ice blue, added opactiy transition to project images on home page, and change the font family to 'Noto Sans'
